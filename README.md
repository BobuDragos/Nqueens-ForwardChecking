# N-Queens with Blocked Squares Python Solution using Forward Checking

This repository contains a Python solution for the N-Queens problem with blocked squares, implemented using forward checking. The N-Queens problem is a classic problem in computer science, which involves placing N chess queens on an N x N chessboard, so that no two queens threaten each other. This problem becomes more challenging when there are blocked squares on the board that cannot be used.

## Requirements
To run the solution, you will need Python 3 installed on your system.
